EZ Card Editor by Junkyard Guard

This will probably be the only build of this program, unless I or someone else finds some bugs.

How to use:
First, open your Pokemon Trading Card game for Gameboy ROM. (.gb or .gbc)
Click on the tab of the type of Pokemon you want to edit (Grass, Fire, etc.)
Here I will explain what every little... well, everything does.

Pokemon:
Name of the Pokemon you want to edit. No, you cannot edit the name. I'm not sure if I will ever implement this either because I don't find it necessary. It's just as easy to hex edit a name.

Level:
Level on the card of the Pokemon you want to edit.

HP:
HP of the Pokemon you want to edit.

First and Second Attack Group Boxes:
The first section is how many energies each attack will cost. You CAN make it cost different energies if you want. You can even make it cost one of every energy if that's what you want to do. Although, I wouldn't recommend it.

Attack Name:
The name of the attack. I haven't yet implemented the actual attack names just because that will take a lot of work. I recommend just copy and pasting from another attack.

Attack Damage:
Pretty obvious. This is how much damage the attack will do.

This next box that doesn't have a name is (I'm pretty sure) for display purposes only (Except for PokePowers).
It handles what should be displayed on the card's attack.
For example, if a damage does 20 + 10 for each damage counter on the defending Pokemon, you would make this box be + so it will show 20+ on the card.
The x is obviously the times operator that is on some cards.
None (Damage) means that this attack does not have an operator but it effects the defending Pokemon in some way, be it a status condition or just damage.
None (No damage) means that this attack does not have an operator and it DOES NOT effect the defending Pokemon. I have found, however, that None (No damage) is on some attacks that damage a random Pokemon (like Legendary Zapdos, Legendary Articuno and etc.) AND on Hitmonlee's Stretch Kick which actually does damage.
And last but not least, Pokemon Power. Kind of obvious. This will put "Pokemon Power" on the left side of the attack's name (where energies usually are). You can potentially give a random Pokemon another Pokemon's PokePower, but I have not tried that yet.

Display Effect:
This is the text on the card under the attack's name. This will NOT change what the effect of the attack is. It will only change what the text says that the attack does. I recommend just copy and pasting from another attack.

Actual Effect:
This is the actual effect that the game executes once you use the attack. This is how you change the attack's effect, but it does not change anything written on the card.
For example, if I change just the Actual Effect and not the Display effect, then Bulbasaur's Leech Seed might say that it will remove 1 damage counter from him, but it will actually do something else entirely. I recommend just copy and pasting from another attack.

Animation:
This is the animation that plays when the attack is used in game. Again, just copy and paste from another attack.

Retreat Cost:
How many energies it takes to retreat. I have the max set at 4 because there's really no reason to set it any higher. But I GUESS if people really want, I can change that.

Weakness:
The Pokemon's Weakness

Resistance:
The Pokemon's Resistance

Rarity:
How rare the card is, be it common, uncommon or rare. I'm actually not sure if this effects how the card packs work. I haven't tested it.

DON'T FORGET TO PRESS 'SAVE CARD' AFTER EACH CARD THAT YOU EDIT

Anyway, that's everything. I have made this program as user-friendly as I could. I'm sure I could do more, but I'm not sure if I will work on this program any more.
